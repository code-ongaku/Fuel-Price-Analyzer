# Fuel-Price-Analyzer
Machine Learning model implemented for real-time market analysis of three categories of fuel in Vancouver and Toronto respectively

• Conducted in-depth data research and analysis to provide insights into fuel prices for both Vancouver and Toronto markets, contributing to informed decision-making in the energy sector.

• Leveraged data science techniques, including Jupyter Notebook and Machine Learning algorithms, to process and extract valuable information from large datasets, optimizing fuel price predictions.

• Effectively visualized data by creating compelling visualizations, including confusion matrices, scatterplots, line graphs, and histograms.

## Learning Outcomes

• Application of Machine Learning Algorithms

• Utilizing Jupyter Notebook

• Real-Time Data Analysis including visual interpretations (Confusion Matrices and Model Accuracy graphs)
